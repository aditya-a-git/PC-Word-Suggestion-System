## English Speller Database / SCOWL v2

The bundled `esdb-en-bilingual.tsv` vocabulary is a generated size-60 word list derived from `en-wl/wordlist` release `rel-2026.02.25` (source commit `7e99edab8e32f9f9ea2b15f249ca8d4d67237410`). It includes American (`A`), British `-ise` (`B`), and British `-ize` (`Z`) spellings with source group, POS, commonness-size, variant-level, and lemma metadata. The optional Australian and size-above-80 UKACD lists are not selected. See [dictionary source and generation details](docs/dictionary-sources.md).

Permission to use, copy, modify, distribute, and sell any part of SCOWLv2, or word lists created from it, is hereby granted without fee, provided that the above copyright notice appears in all copies and that both the above copyright notice and this notice appear in supporting documentation. Kevin Atkinson makes no representations about the suitability of this database for any purpose. It is provided "as is" without express or implied warranty.

SCOWL is derived from many sources, most of which are in the Public Domain. Data from the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) was also used. All data from COCA comes from 3-gram data that is not freely available; however, the usage is within the rights given by the NDA that was signed when purchasing the data. More information on COCA is available at https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/.

The primary source of words for SCOWL comes from 12dicts and ENABLE2K. Both are in the Public Domain, but Alan Beale <biljir@pobox.com> deserves special credit as he is the author of 12dicts and a major contributor to ENABLE2K. In addition, he gave Kevin Atkinson feedback and created a number of special lists that helped improve the overall quality of SCOWL.
